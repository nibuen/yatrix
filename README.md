## The Two-Player Mode

See the Info-Page in the app for a step-by-step guide.

You see YaTriX as a macOS app on the left. Here I start the server-mode and wait for a connection. The serverId is copied to the clipboard.

The web version of YaTriX is running in a Safari browser to the right.
Here I connect to the serverId found on the clipboard.

A two-player game can only be initiated by the server. 
The client then gets a dialog displayed, on which he can start the game on both sides at the same time and with the same squence of blocks.

## By the Way
The two-player mode is implemented using the [peerdart package](https://github.com/MuhammedKpln/peerdart), 
which in turn uses the package [flutter_webrtc](https://github.com/flutter-webrtc/flutter-webrtc).

A special thanks goes to the developers of these packages â€“ and of course to all participants in the flutter ecosystem
